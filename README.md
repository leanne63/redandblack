## redandblack

### *Tech Used*
* WordPress 4.1+  
* PHP 5.x  


### *Description*
WordPress theme with black background, red headers, and light text.


### *Interesting Twists*
- *redandblack* was designed to match an existing regular HTML/CSS-based site with similar coloring and arrangement. However, the red/black color combinations in this theme are as accessibility-friendly as possible.
- *redandblack* allows columns in the theme to be created from regular WordPress pages. To make a column, create a page, and make it a child of a parent page. The parent page's content appears at the top, with each child pages' content flowing into a column underneath the parent's content.


### *Setup Requirements*
Clone into your existing WordPress themes folder. The *redandblack* theme should now be available in your theme list within WordPress.


### *Other Notes*
This theme is not WordPress-theme-reviewed. I did attempt to make it meet all requirements to be acceptable for review and, ultimately, addition to WordPress' theme repository. However, it may need some tweaking.
